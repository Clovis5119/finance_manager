Finance Manager is a program for tracking personal transactions at a detailed level. Banks and third-party apps can only see vendor information and cannot differentiate between different types of goods purchased as part of a single transaction at the same vendor.

This program is designed to make it more convenient to log your transactions, sort them, search through them, and perform calculations on the data for budgeting purposes.

It's extremely bare at the moment, but I'm still learning Python as I go!

Current features:
- Functional Tkinter GUI
- Read existing .csv files
- Add, delete, or edit transaction entries
- Save changes to file

Limitations:
- Rigid transaction categories
- GUI not scalable
- Will probably break as soon as you do anything out of the ordinary

To-do list is quite long.
